Before you run any scripts, you must do at least do the following:

 - Pick IP addresses on your local network for your UML machine
   and its gateway.

 - Specify those addresses in the 'conf' file in this directory.

 - Add the hostname 'theyworkforyou.sandbox' to /etc/hosts.  This
   should correspond to UML_SERVER_IP in the 'conf' file.

FIXME: check all those things in the scripts before startup -
even create-rootfs.py needs the network setup correctly, so that
it can set values in /etc/network/interfaces
