I set up a normal user (alice) and the root user, and created ssh key
pairs for each, entering an empty password, with:

  ssh-keygen -t dsa -f id_dsa.alice
  ssh-keygen -t dsa -f id_dsa.root

... because of this you shouldn't need the passwords too, but for the
record they are:

  alice / blavCook5
  root / poGlogDed8

To shrink the size of the root fs image, try:

  zerofree
