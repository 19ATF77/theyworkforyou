Things To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial configuration:

    Check that conf has been created and set to some sensible value
    *before* creating rootfs.

- Setting up TUN/TAP IP addresses with DHCP:

    This should be possible, but nothing I've tried works.  It's
    probably a case where I need to ask advice.

- Should add an option to "mysociety vhost" to allow deployment of a
  specific version of the site.

- Use the 'git-safe-to-merge' script before deploying or updating.

- At the moment we're not using the packages files from the
  archetypes.  I don't think that necessarily makes sense in this
  situation.  We can't get them without access to the private CVS.
  (The lists are actually build-dependencies, and there's no system
  for automatically installing from them as well.  It could just do
  apt-get build-dep.)

- Add back the instrumentation.

- Shrink the image as much as possible (e.g. zerofree?)

- Switch to using port-based virtual hosts
