Things To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Generate alert email

- Show which lines are used in which test

- Make the report prettier:
    Report overall statistics at the top
    Better CSS

- Generate the test div from a method of Test

- Trick CutyCapt into sending cookies

- Initial configuration:

    Check that conf has been created and set to some sensible value
    *before* creating rootfs.

- Setting up TUN/TAP IP addresses with DHCP:

    This should be possible, but nothing I've tried works.  It's
    probably a case where I need to ask advice.

- Should add an option to "mysociety vhost" to allow deployment of a
  specific version of the site.  (Update: this should now work by
  specifying a particular ref in vhosts.pl.)

- At the moment we're not using the packages files from the
  archetypes.  I don't think that necessarily makes sense in this
  situation.  We can't get them without access to the private CVS.
  (The lists are actually build-dependencies, and there's no system
  for automatically installing from them as well.  It could just do
  apt-get build-dep.)

- Shrink the image as much as possible (e.g. zerofree?)

- Switch to using port-based virtual hosts

- Detecting when the UML machine is "up" on startup is done by making
  requests to the web server.  However, you can leave the web server
  in a broken state on previous run - it might be better to try
  repeated ssh("date",user="root") invocations.

- Generating the coverage reports is hacky at the moment, and
  generates lots of files for every test.  (The rewriting of path
  names, etc. is also rather brittle.)

- When "mysociety vhost" deployment fails, it seems that Apache is
  sometimes not restarted correctly - if one restarts manually
  afterwards, then you get the "This site is down for maintenance" as
  expected.
