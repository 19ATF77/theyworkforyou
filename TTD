Things To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- commit changes to deploy mechanism to CVS

- Try some cookie-based tests

- Set up an alert, and generate email

- Add error text which could be reported with failures

- Show which lines are used in which test

- Make the report prettier:
    Report overall statistics at the top
    Better CSS

- Generate the test div from a method of Test

- Trick CutyCapt into sending cookies

- Initial configuration:

    Check that conf has been created and set to some sensible value
    *before* creating rootfs.

- Setting up TUN/TAP IP addresses with DHCP:

    This should be possible, but nothing I've tried works.  It's
    probably a case where I need to ask advice.

- Should add an option to "mysociety vhost" to allow deployment of a
  specific version of the site.

- Use the 'git-safe-to-merge' script before deploying or updating.

- At the moment we're not using the packages files from the
  archetypes.  I don't think that necessarily makes sense in this
  situation.  We can't get them without access to the private CVS.
  (The lists are actually build-dependencies, and there's no system
  for automatically installing from them as well.  It could just do
  apt-get build-dep.)

- Shrink the image as much as possible (e.g. zerofree?)

- Switch to using port-based virtual hosts

- It's rubbish to use all that CPU on opening and closing SSH
  sessions, instead should just keep one session open
