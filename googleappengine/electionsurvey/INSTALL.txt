So, you want to hack on an election time survey of candidates?
==============================================================

How to install the TheyWorkForYou election 2010 code on
something that can run Python.

1. Grab the TheyWorkForYou code. You can snaffle it from
github. 
$ git clone http://github.com/mysociety/theyworkforyou.git

2. Go into the Election Survey directory.
$ cd theyworkforyou/googleappengine/electionsurvey
There's a local fixed copy of the Google AppEngine SDK in
that directory, so you don't need to download it separately.

3. Do you want to:
    a) use an existing developer test database, if so go to 4)
    b) make a new developer test database, if so go to 6)

4. Download the developer database, called something like 
mouse.datastore, into the electionsurvey directory.

5. Start the local development server pointing to the database.
$ python2.5 ./google_appengine/dev_appserver.py . --datastore_path=mouse.datastore
You have finished.

6. You'll need to run a copy of the server, making a new database.
$ python2.5 ./google_appengine/dev_appserver.py . --datastore_path=test.datastore

7. And load some test data into it.
$ cd bin
$ ./load_freshdata.py --host=localhost candidates-test-constituency.json test-refined-issues.csv national-issues.csv

What you have then looks a bit like Django, only it is using the AppEngine
datastore models, so will behave oddly in many regards. Some other tips:


Can I have some other development tips, please, thank you
=========================================================

1. There's an AppEngine development admin interface.
    http://localhost:8080/_ah/admin/

2. If you're sending email, you can add a test host and port with these sort of
parameters to dev_appserver.
    --smtp_host=localhost  --smtp_port=9999
There's a copy of smtps.py in electionsurvey/bin which is a debug SMTP server.
