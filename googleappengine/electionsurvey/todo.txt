On main quiz, "has not been asked" when they've had postal survey is wrong
    make admin page show postal sent too
Grep for have sent email, and add have sent post as well (in a few days time, Thursdayish)

Postal

Other things

"Candidates not parties" or "candidates not party leaders" is the marketing line
- "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"

Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Search for surveys filled in from funny IPs
Search for surveys filled in which email is invalidated for now
