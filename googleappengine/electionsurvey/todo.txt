Add your phone number?
Option to just not do survey?

Rename PPC to something else everywhere


- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- Fix line up of party icons and name
- Improve speed of loading
  * Don't regenerate other candidate bit over and over again
- Strip down the content of homepage to something much more mininmalist, and much more confident
- Link to blog post for explanation?
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."
- Whole thing could be more centered, I suppose. Like WTT or FMS
- You could also make the postcode box really big, like Richard Pope specialises in
- Change "This website is run by mySociety, a registered charity." to as on TWFY
- Huge big text on survey page should be
  "Scan the issues, and click on the ones that you feel strongest about"
- When no party image, format it a bit better
  e.g. Mad Cap Tom http://election.theyworkforyou.com/quiz/SW1P3LB
- Box each issue more before they go blue
- Make font larger, screen narrower, so only 10 words per line
- Alternate colours of each question so easier to read
- Once you open an issue, that is where it should say "4 of your candidates have answered the survey. 3 haven't yet."
- Break each candidate answer visually into a box
- Would be great if it said "Bob Smith (Conservative) *agrees* with the above statement about tax. They said "xxxxxx""
- Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?
- Change URL to be something other than quiz

Add options to share on most popular social networking sites
Function to share answers / embed in blog?

Make sure it advertises TheyWorkForYou alert signups etc

Test postcode lookup with constituency with & in name

When we start displaying the survey answers, stop resubmit of survey


Write script for making CSV file for mail merge

Fix 404 to say right message


Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Do another patch of sending to changed emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?



Other things
============

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
