Do this next
============

Somehow don't allow changing of issues for a constituency which has already been sent

What should it do if they've already filled in the survey?
    - can edit their answers and resubmit, until a deadline?
    - "I think they can probably change anything up to the day before the user survey goes live"

Make it autosave, probably using:
    * Test it in IE: http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/fixedPosition.html
    * Two AJAX requests might go past each other out of order - have serial number counting up? send time?

Separate local from national, ask national first, only then show local
Free text fields
    * Make sure autosave works with Â£ signs and other unicode
