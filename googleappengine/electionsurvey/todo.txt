Do this next
============

Storing TheyWorkForYou/HearFromYourMP/DemocracyClub signups in a local model

- Post blog post about how national issues were decided




3. Francis and I talked quite a lot about there being an aspect of
teasing on the site - namely saying "Three candidates agree with this
statement, but we won't show you who unless you sign up to TWFY". I am
suspecting that this will be impossible to deliver in time, so I have
a new suggestion. Namely, within each set of candidate responses to a
statement you add a clear, bright email subs box at the bottom of the
candidates saying saying "TheyWorkForYou thinks it is important that
we all pay a little bit of attention to what our MPs do once elected.
Please sign up so we can update you on what your new MP gets up to."

Work out design way to get people to track MPs by email after election
- Email me if you get more data?
Work out technical side of TheyWorkForYou and HearFromYourMP signups

Seb's big quotes round statement are nice

- Call it candidate explorer
- Link to blog post for explanation
- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

- Change URL to be something other than quiz, maybe candidate explorer
    * update tweet this link
- Memcache each constituency
- Test on different browsers

Do those for which we have postal address, but no valid email address again
Grep for have sent email, and add have sent post as well (in a few days time, Thursdayish)
Then do those that haven't replied to the survey

Try using Django 1.1 like this, maybe will reduce errors?

Other things
============

Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Search for surveys filled in from funny IPs
Search for surveys filled in which email is invalidated for now
Do another patch of sending to all emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?

Mail when survey live:
    Matthew Harris 

Actively refused to answer (with reason):
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)
    Marcus Jones, Nuneaton (Conservative)
    Yvonne Fovargue, Markerfield (Labour)

Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
