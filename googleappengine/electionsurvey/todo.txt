Do this next
============

Storing TheyWorkForYou/HearFromYourMP/DemocracyClub signups in a local model

Work out design way to get people to track MPs by email after election
- Email me if you get more data?
Work out technical side of TheyWorkForYou and HearFromYourMP signups

Link to blog post for explanation

- Call it candidate explorer
- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

- Change URL to be something other than quiz, maybe candidate explorer
    * update tweet this link

Postal
- Do those for which we have postal address, but no valid email address again
- Grep for have sent email, and add have sent post as well (in a few days time, Thursdayish)
- Then do those that haven't replied to the survey




Other things
============

Try using Django 1.1 like this, maybe will reduce errors?
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries.html


Test on different browsers
Memcache each constituency

Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Search for surveys filled in from funny IPs
Search for surveys filled in which email is invalidated for now
Do another patch of sending to all emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?

Mail when survey live:
    Matthew Harris 

Actively refused to answer (with reason):
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)
    Marcus Jones, Nuneaton (Conservative)
    Yvonne Fovargue, Markerfield (Labour)

Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
