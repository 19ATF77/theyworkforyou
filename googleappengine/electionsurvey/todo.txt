Do this next
============

Sort out slugs linking to democracyclub constituency pages

2. Some design fixes to make it more obvious what you are supposed to
do after you've put in your postcode. This would include:
   * Centering the entire thing on the page
   * Get rid of the "Click to find out!" link, and make it more
obvious that each entire statement is itself a clickable item,
preferably in very clear quotation marks. Each one should look a bit
like a very big button, I guess. This is where I'm looking for
Matthew's input, as I'm not quite sure how to make this work.
   * Once you click to open an issue, that issue and all the comments
under it need to be made more separate from the rest of the page,
either by being clearly boxed in, or whitespace, or something.
  * At the moment, when it says someone "Disagrees with the above
statement" it isn't obvious if it means a) the actual statement they
disagree with b) the statement by the previous candidate c) some other
statement further up the page. This is the biggest UI challenge this
entire thing faces, I think. Perhaps when you mouse over the words
"Above statement" it could flash the actual statement text?
  * Randomise the ordering of the issues from how they are now, or
arrange the statements "left wing, right wing, left wing right wing".
I only say this because the first four are all in a left wing voice
(even though there are a carefully balanced number overall), which
means if you only scan the top of the questions for a second it looks
v much like a left wing survey. This might even count for the original
survey itself, actually. Which might explain the low Tory response
rates. Argh.


3. Francis and I talked quite a lot about there being an aspect of
teasing on the site - namely saying "Three candidates agree with this
statement, but we won't show you who unless you sign up to TWFY". I am
suspecting that this will be impossible to deliver in time, so I have
a new suggestion. Namely, within each set of candidate responses to a
statement you add a clear, bright email subs box at the bottom of the
candidates saying saying "TheyWorkForYou thinks it is important that
we all pay a little bit of attention to what our MPs do once elected.
Please sign up so we can update you on what your new MP gets up to."

Seb's big quotes round statement are nice


My feeling is that people who've not responded should just have "no
response" or something very unwordy in place of their answer (rather
than doing it inline with the questions/answers).  i.e. the whole
"click to find their email address" or "click to bug them" stuff
should happen at the bottom of the page.  At the top there should be a
statement about who's not answered and that they can help chase up at
the end.

- get the filled in vs. no email thing just right (and even no address)
- "is neutral with" is not good wording
- Link to blog post for explanation?
- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

- Link to hassle interface
Work out design way to get people to track MPs by email after election
- Email me if you get more data?
Work out technical side of TheyWorkForYou and HearFromYourMP signups

- Once you open an issue, that is where it should say "4 of your candidates have answered the survey. 3 haven't yet."
- Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?
- Change URL to be something other than quiz
- Memcache each constituency
- Test on different browsers
- Focus postcode box at start? document.postcodeForm.pc.focus() is what WTT does

Add options to share on 
    Facebook
    Twitter

Load in postal address into database
Write script for making CSV file for mail merge
    - name
    - constituency name
    - survey token
    - address data
Do those for which we have postal address, but no valid email address, first
Then do those that haven't replied to the survey


Mail when survey live:
    Matthew Harris 

Actively refused to answer (with reason):
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)
    Marcus Jones, Nuneaton (Conservative)



Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Do another patch of sending to changed emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?



Other things
============

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
