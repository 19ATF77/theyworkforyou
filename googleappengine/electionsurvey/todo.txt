Do this next
============

Do a dump for analysis
    include columns for party etc.

Consider sorting them by order that they answered :0
- with a line between those who answered before/after quiz launch

Put white space below "Help us get answers from all your candidates!"
box at bottom, so when you click internal link to it it always
scrolls to top of browser

Say more about privacy by emails

"Change constituency" link - i.e. go back to postcode box

Opt-in to get email when there are more results in your constituency?
    store date/time when they sign up to alerts

Change heading for Facebook to get to be job interview
Tell friends at bottom as well for people who got that far
    and on front page?

Change Independent logo to be a grey blob or something

"Well done on all the hard work! Once small suggestion - the hassling
interface after the quiz seems a bit disjointed.  Maybe it should warn
you you are about to leave the site, and prompt you to tell them that
you went to the site to inform yourself what to do with your vote and
were disapointed to not see them listed?"

"Perhaps putting the standard TWFY "help" link on the page somewhere
would go a long way towards righting that "



Put constituency tag in twitter
    http://code.google.com/p/constituencyvolunteernetwork/source/browse/trunk/hashtags.py
    slug is the same as the DC slug, except it doesnt take & into account.

Add contact link

Log answers people give in database? So can share.
Have a choice of candidates at the end, say who you now like most

Link to blog posts for explanation
    http://www.democracyclub.org.uk/blog/2010/04/candidate-survey-faq/

Postal
- AGAIN - Do those for which we have postal address, but no valid email address
- Do those that haven't replied to the survey, but have postal address (even if emaield)

Change domain to better one?


Publicity
=========

    How about we offer to blog about people who
    hassle their candidates in the most imaginative (but non threatening)
    manner?

mySociety news email list
mySociety blog post

Public Whip mailing
TheyWorkForYou other pages

Check leaders pages:

Other things
============

Remove democracy club slug from model, is not needed really now

"Candidates not parties" or "candidates not party leaders" is the marketing line
- "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

Be able to close questions in quiz

Try using Django 1.1 like this, maybe will reduce errors?
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries.html


Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Search for surveys filled in from funny IPs
Search for surveys filled in which email is invalidated for now
Do another patch of sending to all emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?

Mail when survey live:
    Matthew Harris 

Actively refused to answer (with reason):
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)
    Marcus Jones, Nuneaton (Conservative)
    Yvonne Fovargue, Markerfield (Labour)

Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
