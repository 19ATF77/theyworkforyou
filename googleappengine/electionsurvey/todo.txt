Things to talk to Tom about:

Who is doing mail merge
Media publicity
What should wording be to get their vote


Do this next
============

- Link to blog post for explanation?
- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

- Box each issue more before they go blue
- Make font larger, screen narrower, so only 10 words per line
- Alternate colours of each question so easier to read
- Once you open an issue, that is where it should say "4 of your candidates have answered the survey. 3 haven't yet."
- Break each candidate answer visually into a box
- Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?
- Change URL to be something other than quiz
- Memcache each constituency
- Link to hassle interface
- Test on different browsers

Add options to share on most popular social networking sites

Make sure it advertises TheyWorkForYou alert signups etc



Write script for making CSV file for mail merge

Fix 404 to say right message


Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Do another patch of sending to changed emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?



Other things
============

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
