Policy questions
================

Ask Tom what form token is going to need for postal

Will it be multiple pages? Does it need a save as you're going along? Maybe
free text separate page to main survey?

When can a candidate edit their answers?

Ask Edmund about candidate identifiers for deleted / renamed candidates


Do this next
============

Make a very simple holding page, saying this is where election stuff will sit
Use TheyWorkForYou branding and logo for it
Check that can deploy that Django 1.1 code to GAE

Set it up to work on election.theyworkforyou.com

Load in every candidate from YourNextMP, and add them to local data store
Create a random token for each candidate to use to authenticate them
Make front page say how many candidates are known about

Make admin interface work, and sort out its authentication when deployed

In DemocracyClub, add very short API which sends list of refined issues
Load in list of refined issues 

Make form / template to display candidate survey questions
    (don't bother with fancy free text, or I don't like this question stuff)
Store the results of the survey in a new model table and thank them

Code to email survey to each candidate (a few at a time, via admin interface)
