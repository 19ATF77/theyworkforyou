Do this next
============

Somehow don't allow changing of issues for a constituency which has already been sent
Note if an email address has changed 
    * Option to resend survey

What should it do if they've already filled in the survey?
    - can edit their answers and resubmit, until a deadline?

Make it autosave, probably using:
    * Get whole state of form http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
    * Hook whenever a widget changes in form
    * Submit to server into special autosave database field holding query string
    * Show floating flash to make it clear it is doing that / change text
    * Recover it later
With an "I'm done" button

Make sure backup is working

Make sure you can get the data out again with agreements and things recorded
right before you send it out to real candidates.

Ask, do we want to show the reference_url links on the survey?
