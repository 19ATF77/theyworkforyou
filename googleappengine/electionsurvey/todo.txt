Do this next
============

Do a dump for analysis
    include columns for party etc.

Tell friends at bottom as well for people who got that far
    and on front page?


Send final reminder mail on Sunday:
> A good possible refusenik hook is (IMO) to say "You may not be aware that X
> other candidates for your party have filled it in. They understand that it
> is worth doing, I hope we can persuade you too"
> 
> It could even be in the subject line "144 other Labour PPCs have gone on the
> record - please join them"


Publicity
=========

Public Whip mailing



Other things
============

Remove democracy club slug from model, is not needed really now

Try using Django 1.1 like this, maybe will reduce errors?
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries.html


Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Search for surveys filled in from funny IPs
Search for surveys filled in which email is invalidated for now
Do another patch of sending to all emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?

Actively refused to answer (with reason):
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)
    Marcus Jones, Nuneaton (Conservative)
    Yvonne Fovargue, Markerfield (Labour)

Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows

Opt-in to get email when there are more results in your constituency?
    store date/time when they sign up to alerts
