Things to talk to Tom about:

Who is doing mail merge
What should wording be to get TWFY signup
Media publicity (Seb)


Do this next
============

- Link to blog post for explanation?
- Remove quiz - "Explore TheyWorkForYou's Unprecedented Candidate Survey, brought to you by 6000 volunteers"
- "TheyWorkForYou is the UK's main site for tracking what MPs get up to. At this election we've recruited an army of volunteers to help find out where the people who want to become MPs stand."

- Link to hassle interface
Work out design way to get email
Work out technical side of TheyWorkForYou and HearFromYourMP signups

- Once you open an issue, that is where it should say "4 of your candidates have answered the survey. 3 haven't yet."
- Sort by surname like on a ballot paper?
- Change URL to be something other than quiz
- Memcache each constituency
- Test on different browsers
- Focus postcode box at start? document.postcodeForm.pc.focus() is what WTT does

Write script for making CSV file for mail merge

Add options to share on most popular social networking sites


Mail when survey live:
    Matthew Harris 

Actively refused to answer:
    Michael Meacher, Oldham West (Labour)



Check for people who've autosaved but not filled in and do special mail
Do another patch of sending to changed emails
- Make sure you add Message ID and Date this time
    iso/pylib/sendemail.py has python code we use, dunno why that's not in
    generic pylib that adds date, message-id, does header escaping, etc.
Ask PPCs who have done survey to motivate other party members to do survey?



Other things
============

Import voting record from Public Whip for the national issues which are linked to divisions
Display that in results of quiz

Rename log as log_and_save

Really autosave should check for conflicts between two browser windows
