TheyWorkForYou User-Mode Linux Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scripts in this directory allow you to create a running version of
TheyWorkForYou in a User-Mode Linux virtual machine, and then allow
you to run a set of tests to check that the basic functionality works.

== WARNING =============================================================

  Before you run any scripts, you must do at least do the following:

   - Pick IP addresses on your local network for your UML machine
     and its gateway.

   - Specify those addresses in the 'conf' file in this directory.

   - Make sure that /etc/hosts has a mapping from the
     UML_SERVER_HOSTNAME to UML_SERVER_IP.

========================================================================

The important scripts are:

  ./create-rootfs.py

      This will create a root filesystem image suitable for User-Mode
      Linux with networking set up according to the specification in
      the 'conf' file and add an SSH public key for root.

  ./start-server.py

      This script starts up the UML machine; this is called anyway by
      ./setup-mysociety-deploy so you will need to use this often.

  ./ssh-root
  ./ssh-alice

      These helper scripts will use ssh to log you into the UML
      machine as either root or the test user (alice)

  ./stop-server

      This script will shut down the UML machine cleanly.

  ./setup-mysociety-deploy.py

      This script deploys TheyWorkForYou onto a UML machine and runs a
      set of tests.  If "-r" or "--reuse-image" is specified, the
      script attempts to reuse any running image or starts from the
      root filesystem in uml-rootfs-test.  If not, it will start from
      scratch by copying uml-rootfs-pristine (which should be a basic
      image created with ./create-root-fs.py) over uml-rootfs-test and
      deploying onto a new UML machine based on that image.

      This script may call ./start-server (if required).

  ./run_main_tests.py

      This script runs the tests of main website functionality; these
      are the same as those that are run by
      ./setup-mysociety-deploy.py, without the time-consuming tests of
      deploying the site's source code and importing data.

The tests will generate browseable HTML output in ./output/latest/
