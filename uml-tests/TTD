Things To Do
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After testing installation with Louise, added the following TODOs:

- Make the web server port also configurable via the conf file (see
  "git grep 8042")

- Document the cutycapt submodule

- Take out exim and postgresql from the debootstrap

- Need to lower shared_buffers down to 24M from 32M when creating the image

- create-rootfs.py needs to set up Apache initially to work on port 8042

- cutycapt needs to be run under xvfb - currently this produces an
  error on balti

- Generating the coverage reports is hacky at the moment, and
  pointlessly generates lots of files for every test.  (The rewriting
  of path names, etc. is also rather brittle.)

========================================================================

- Generate alert email

- Show which lines are used in which test

- Make the report prettier:
    Report overall statistics at the top
    Better CSS

- Generate the test div from a method of Test

- Trick CutyCapt into sending cookies


# - Setting up TUN/TAP IP addresses with DHCP:
# 
#     This should be possible, but nothing I've tried works.  It's
#     probably a case where I need to ask advice.
# 
# - Should add an option to "mysociety vhost" to allow deployment of a
#   specific version of the site.  (Update: this should now work by
#   specifying a particular ref in vhosts.pl.)

- Update: not sure if this still applies...  At the moment we're not
  using the packages files from the archetypes.  I don't think that
  necessarily makes sense in this situation.  We can't get them
  without access to the private CVS.  (The lists are actually
  build-dependencies, and there's no system for automatically
  installing from them as well.  It could just do apt-get build-dep.)

- Shrink the image as much as possible (e.g. zerofree?)

- Update: not sure if this is still true....  Leading whitespace is
  lost in coverage reports.
