The parldata has a very reduced set of data - just one week from 2009:

We keep 2009-10-26 to 2009-10-31 (inclusive) except in the case of
ni, where we use 2009-10-12 to 2009-10-17, otherwise there'd be no
data there.

parlparse was grabbed from svn, except that I've only kept MPs who are
current or left parliament in 1995 or later, since that cuts out a lot
of historical data:

  xml_grep --pretty_print indented 'member[@todate=~/^(9999-12-31|2|199[56789])/]' all-members.xml >reduced-all-members.xml

people.xml was then updated with ./personsets.py
