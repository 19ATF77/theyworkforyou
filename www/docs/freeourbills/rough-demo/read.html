New subsection (6B) provides that an order under subsection (6A) is of no effect unless there is also an order in place under new section 90B, giving members equality with creditors in dissolution and winding up. This aims to protect the position of members: if no order were made under s.90B, an increase in wholesale (non-member) funding would put them at greater risk in the event of an insolvency, as funds would be used to satisfy a larger pool of creditors first.

<blockquote>
 New subsection (6C) provides that an order under subsection (6A) may not be amended or revoked if the effect is to reduce the percentage specified in the order. The purpose is to ensure that the funding limit, once increased, cannot be reduced. If the Treasury were able to raise the funding limit and later reduce it, that could deter building societies from taking advantage of the raised funding limit. There would be no certainty that they could continue to use that amount of wholesale funding in the future.

A mutual society is a building society, a friendly society (within the meaning of the Friendly Societies Act 1992) or an industrial and provident society (subsection (9)). A subsidiary of a mutual society is a company in which the society holds or controls a majority of the voting rights and in relation to which the society can appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors (subsection (11)).</blockquote>

Subsection (4) requires the Treasury to authorise such distributions and to prescribe limits. If an order made under clause 3 gives effect to clause 4, it will be necessary for the Treasury to authorise distributions and prescribe limits for subsection (3) of clause 4 to work.
<br>The clause is similar to the provisions on distributions of funds on mergers of building societies in s.96(4) to (6) of the Building Societies Act 1986. It will create a less onerous procedure for distributions of funds in transfers to subsidiaries of other mutuals, in particular for distributions in transfers of building societies, which are currently limited to shareholding members of two or more years' standing under s.100(9) of the 1986 Act.
