Subject: Your payment for the TheyWorkForYou API has failed
Hi,

I'm afraid that when we tried to take payment for your subscription to the
TheyWorkForYou API, it failed. We'll try again in three days time, but
please could you log in to TheyWorkForYou and check that your payment details
are up to date:

In the meantime, your quota has not been reset.

Yours,
